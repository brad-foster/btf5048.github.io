description: Built using ruby on rails, PoliConnect is a platform to anonymously connect policy makers to policy experts in order to foster a frank dialogue that will ideally lead to better policy. This was built at D.C. Science Hack Day where our team took home the Policy Award. I contributed to the front and backend.
